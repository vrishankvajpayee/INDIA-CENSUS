# INDIA-CENSUS
Population of districts
The census contains population of 640 districts and contains information about each district.
Each district has 118 attributes which helps government to work on various fields.

Here I have used basic python libraries such as pandas and numpy for the sorting,merging of the attributes moreover, 
"groupby" function has been used to perform arithmetic operations on the same.
